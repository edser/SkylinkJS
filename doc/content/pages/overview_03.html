<h1>Overview - Persistent (Scheduled) vs Dynamic Room connection sessions</h1>
<article class="_first">
  <img src="content/img/overview_04.png" width="350px">
  <p>For Persistent enabled <b>App Key</b>s, the <b>Room</b>s (in which would be called Persistent <b>Room</b>s)
  will have a scheduled client connection sessions instead of dynamic connection sessions where a fixed
  starting datetime and duration is set. By default, the feature is turned off.</p>

  <h3>Persistent Room</h3>
  <img src="content/img/overview_05.svg" width="650px">
  <p>For Persistent <b>Room</b>s, the server will only accept connection sessions of starting datetime, duration
  that matches the specified scheduled connection session (meeting) that is created with the REST API Meeting resources.</p>
  <p>If the requested starting datetime, duration does not match any existing scheduled connection sessions (meeting),
  the connection session will not start and will be rejected. This will only work if the requested starting datetime, duration
  matches any existing scheduled connection sessions in the <b>Room</b>. Note that hash authentication method is required for
  Persistent enabled <b>Room</b>s connection sessions.</p>
  <h4>To enable Persistent Room feature:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><span>Enable the <u>Persistent Room</u> feature on the <a href="https://console.temasys.io">Temasys Console</a> for
    the <b>App Key</b>. You can also enable it via REST API by a PUT request to
    <code class="route">PUT /rest/apps/:appkey</code> and toggle the <code>"room"</code> (boolean) property.</span></li>
    <li><span>Create the meeting schedule via REST API by a POST request to
    <code class="route">POST /rest/meetings/</code> and provide the <b>Room</b> name (<code>"rid"</code> property - string),
    <b>App Key</b> (<code>"api"</code> property - string), starting datetime stamp (ISO 8601) (<code>"start"</code> - string)
    and duration (in hours) (<code>"len"</code> - number).</span></li>
    <li><span>Start the connection session based on the created meeting schedule with the same <b>Room</b> name,
    <b>App Key</b>, starting datetime stamp and duration with the hash authentication method.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <p>You can also retrieve the list of scheduled meetings with the GET request to
  <code class="route">GET /rest/meetings/:appkey</code> or delete a scheduled meeting with the DELETE request to
  <code class="route">DELETE /rest/meetings/:meetingid</code>.</p>

  <h3>Dyanmic Room (non-Persistent)</h3>
  <img src="content/img/overview_06.svg" width="650px">
  <p>For Dynamic <b>Room</b>s (when Persistent feature is turned off), the server will accept
  connection sessions regardless of starting datetime or duration. All it needs is to ensure that the
  authentication passes regardless of authentication method. This is the default setting.</p>
