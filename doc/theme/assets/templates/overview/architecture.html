  <p>In each Temasys Platform <b>Account</b>, there are a number of <b>App</b>s, in which contains <b>App Key</b>s to
    access the <b>App</b> space to start connection with other Peers in the same <b>Room</b>.</p>
  <p><b>App Key</b>s can be considered as access tokens to access the <b>App</b> space, which contains a list of <b>Room</b>s, identified by its name.</p>
  <p>Each client connection to the <b>Room</b> is a session, and before it can start, the <b>App Key</b> used as an access token
  has to be authenticated first. The starting datetime and duration of the session is based on and set by the authentication method used.</p>
  <p>Once authentication has been successful, the <b>Room</b> will open a <b>Socket</b> connection to the server to
  start the connection session, and once client connection session has started, the received <b>Peer</b> connections
  will be the connection sessions from other clients. If the <b>Peer</b> connection has audio or video media to send, it
  will return <b>Stream</b>s or if <b>Datachannel</b> connections are enabled for both clients, the <b>Datachannel</b>
  connection would be received. The <b>Datatransfer</b> session will be received if client or other client is sending data through the <b>Datachannel</b> connection.</p>
